# CPNT201 Achievements 2: Create a Node Express Hello-World Project
- Author: Rustu Mesut Eser
- Installing expressJS as a dependency was easy.
- Hello world example was not hard to setup and you can see some aspects of connection between routes and frontend.
- You can mess around little bit by changing the port or info you send to frontend in this simple code.
- It also shows basics of routing and explains different routing methods in next chapters.
- To start the app use `npm run start` then load http://localhost:3000/ in a browser to see the output.
